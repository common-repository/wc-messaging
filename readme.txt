== Description ==

**WC Messaging :** The WC Messaging plugin integrates WhatsApp Cloud Business API with WooCommerce. It sends free automated WhatsApp notifications for WooCommerce orders.

**Note:** Added support for blocked checkout

To use the WC messaging plugin, you need a mobile number that is not associated with WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business on your mobile device. This number will be used exclusively for the WhatsApp Cloud API. You will still receive calls and SMS on this number, but it cannot be used with the WhatsApp mobile app. Facebook's WhatsApp Cloud API restricts a mobile number to be used either with the mobile app or the cloud API, but not both. read more about [phone number requirement in WhatsApp cloud api](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/phone-numbers).

**WC Messaging Pro :** WhatsApp WooCommerce plugin facilitates two-way communication between customers and businesses, enabling customers to seek support directly through WhatsApp. It also offers full-time support for any order-related queries or follow-ups, enhancing the overall customer experience.
